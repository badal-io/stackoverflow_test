# Best practices

## Naming convention for LookML elements

* Spaces and special characters: Filenames cannot include spaces or any of the following characters: / ? * : | " < > %
* File extensions: When creating LookML files with the Looker IDE, Looker will automatically add the .lkml extension to the end of the filename if you don't include the extension manually. For example, if you enter the filename flights_data_tests, Looker will name the file flights_data_tests.lkml

## File types:

* Model files with the file extension .model.lkml
* View files with the file extension .view.lkml
* Project manifest files that are always named manifest.lkml
* Dashboard files with the file extension .dashboard.lookml
* Document files with the file extension .md
* Locale strings files with the file extension .strings.json
* Generic LookML files, which are used for the following types of files:
   * Explore files with the file extension .explore.lkml
   * Data test files with the file extension .lkml
   * Refinements files with the file extension .lkml
   * Any other files you're using to house LookML elements
