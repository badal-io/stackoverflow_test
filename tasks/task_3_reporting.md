# Task

Generate LookML dashboards for a looker project 'stackoverflow_test' that uses 'stackoverflow_test' model file.

Do a comprehensive research on building LookML dashboards taking into account this document and the information that you can find yourself.

# Database/Connection

This Looker project is connected to a database in BigQuery 

# Model file
The model file is already created with the connection defined.

* Add 'include` lines to include elements from LookML_Dashboards folder.

A common practice is to include all LookML dashboards in a model by using a wildcard:
`include: "*.dashboard.lookml"`

or, if your LookML dashboards appear within a folder in the IDE, use the path to their location
`include: "/path/*.dashboard.lookml"`


# Project structure

* Create folders:
   * LookML_Dashboards (for LookML dashboards)

# Reporting

## Dashboard 1

Create a dashboard with general info from both of big explores (stackoverflow_badges_users and stackoverflow_comments_users)

* Name: StackOverflow Badges and Comments
* Filters: Add filters for main string dimensions + filter for both date dimensions for comments and badges. 
* Tiles: 4 single value tiles with general information (total number of something)
2-3 tiles of bar/column charts to show distributions of totals by date or some category
* Text tiles: create a text tile with a short description of the dashboard
