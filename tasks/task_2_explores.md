# Task

Generate LookML explores for a looker project 'stackoverflow_test' that uses 'stackoverflow_test' model file.

# Database/Connection

This Looker project is connected to a database in BigQuery (GCP)

# Model file
The model file is already created with the connection defined.

* Add 'include` lines to include elements from Explores folder.

# Project structure

* Create folders:
   * Explores (for explore lookml files)
        * create a single file and put all explores there

# Explores:
## Explore 1:
* name: stackoverflow_badges_users
* label: 'StackOverflow. Badges with Users'
* join logic:
  join two views using user_id from badges and id from users.
* View 1:
   * stackoverflow_badges
   * view label: `Badges`
* View 2:
   * stackoverflow_users 
   * view label: `Users`

* Join type: left join
* relationship: many to one

## Explore 2:
* name: stackoverflow_comments_users
* label: 'StackOverflow. Comments with Users'
* join logic:
  join two views using user_id from badges and id from users.
* View 1:
   * stackoverflow_comments
   * view label: `Comments`
* View 2:
   * stackoverflow_users 
   * view label: `Users`

* Join type: left join
* relationship: many to one

## Other Explores:
create single explores for each view (views 1-3)

# Defining an explore

## Don't forget to use include
For the explore file `include` has to be used to inlude files or folders with the view files.
If there is a folder with all views it's better to include just it instead of all files.

## relationships paratemeter
Relationships in LookML describe the cardinality between a base view and a joined view. This information is crucial for Looker’s query engine to generate efficient and correct SQL, especially for aggregations. The relationship parameter is a best practice to always include in a join.

Types of Relationships
* **many_to_one**: Many rows in the base view correspond to one row in the joined view. This is the most common relationship for joining a fact table to a dimension table. For example, many orders can be associated with one customer.
* **one_to_one**: Every row in the base view corresponds to exactly one row in the joined view.
* **one_to_many**: One row in the base view corresponds to many rows in the joined view. For example, a single order can have many order_items.
* **many_to_many**: Many rows in the base view correspond to many rows in the joined view. This is the most complex relationship.

## type for join parameter
type lets you describe the type of join that you want to perform.

The possible join type values are described in these sections of this page:

* left_outer (the default value)
* full_outer
* inner
* cross

### from vs view_name vs label

Using from
You should use this option if you want to create multiple Explores from the same view and also want to reference fields differently for each Explore:
```
explore: customer {
  from: user
}
# Would appear in the Explore menu as 'Customer'
# Fields would appear like 'Customer Name'
# You would reference fields like ${customer.name}

explore: buyer {
  from: user
}
# Would appear in the Explore menu as 'Buyer'
# Fields would appear like 'Buyer Name'
# You would reference fields like ${buyer.name}
```

Using view_name
You should use this option if you want to create multiple Explores from the same view, and you want to reference fields the same way for each Explore:
```
explore: customer {
  view_name: user
}
# Would appear in the Explore menu as 'Customer'
# Fields would appear like 'User Name'
# You would reference fields like ${user.name}

explore: buyer {
  view_name: user
}
# Would appear in the Explore menu as 'Buyer'
# Fields would appear like 'User Name'
# You would reference fields like ${user.name}
```
Using label
You should use this option if you don't need to create multiple Explores from the same view, but want the Explore's name to appear differently in the Explore menu:
```
explore: user {
  label: "Customer"
}
# Would appear in the Explore menu as 'Customer'
# Fields would appear like 'User Name'
# You would reference fields like ${user.name}
```

from is rarely used with explore
It's not very common to use from to re-name an Explore. Although there are legitimate use cases, if you find yourself wanting to use this parameter, consider if you can simply rename the underlying view instead. It's much more common to rename joins using the join-level from parameter.

### example of a simple single view explore

```
explore: explore_name {
   label: "Explore Label"
   view_name: view_name
}
```
